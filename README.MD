# PasQOI

A Pascal implementation of [Quite OK Image Format](https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi).

PASQOI16 - This is implementation for Turbo Pascal (16-bit) with buffered read/write (due to CPU Arch restriction, it is impossible handle more then 64kb RAM in one memory structure).

Next few days, I'll add implementation for 32/64-bit world.

**Production use warning**: QOI file format is not finalized yet. You can track progress [here in the original repository](https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi/issues/48).
